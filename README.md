# MoonShot_Guitar_Build

From time to time at Team One we have speakers come in and tell us about the awesome work they have been a part of. At this event we had speaker Brent Bushnell from Two Bit Circus. Two Bit Circus does really cool builds to help kids learn core principles in an interesting interactive way. 

For this event the creative technologist group was asked to build an installation with the concept “Science is then new rock and roll.” With that in mind we built a carnival like installation “Brain vs Brawn”.

We made 7ft guitars with a ladder of RGB addressable LEDs up the neck. The bass guitar was the brawn in which we made a high-striker carnival game that worked by hitting a drum pad with a mallet to see how many LEDs you could light up depending on the force of the strike. The second guitar was a hacked EEG that gave readings on how hard you could concentrate. The more focused you could become determined on how many LEDs one could light up.
